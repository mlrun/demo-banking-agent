========

Implements the training pipeline for the Banking Agent Demo application using MLRun and scikit-learn. This module provides a handler function to train a RandomForestClassifier on provided training and test datasets, apply MLRun tracking and analysis features, and log the trained model as an artifact for downstream serving and inference.

Key functionalities include:

- Splitting input DataFrames into features and labels
- Initializing and training a RandomForestClassifier with configurable hyperparameters
- Integrating MLRun for experiment tracking, model analysis, and artifact management
- Logging the trained model artifact and returning its URI for use in deployment pipelines

This module is intended to be used as part of an MLRun pipeline for automated model training, evaluation, and deployment in the banking agent workflow.
